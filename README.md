# The Ledger of Us — A Manifesto for Constitutional Money

Money should not be neutral. It should recognize and fund what measurably improves shared human dignity. **Constitutional money** ties monetary value to **proof of impact**, not to market speculation or state priorities. Each funded action receives a public **alignment coefficient (α)** decided by a **global rotating jury** from a **proof dossier**. α can go **up or down** at periodic re-evaluations (e.g., every 6 months). Strong impact → strong money.

---

## Why this, why now
Today’s money creation serves two powers: **private capital** (bank credit where returns look highest) and the **nation-state** (tax/debt/sovereignty rails). Promised basics—**decent housing, primary health, clean water, ecological habitability, social cohesion**—remain underfunded. We propose a narrow, auditable monetary rail that **only** recognizes value when actions **prove** they served those objectives.

---

## First principles
1. **Public purpose first** — Clear constitutional objectives (housing, health, water, energy sobriety, social cohesion, etc.).  
2. **Proof over promise** — Value after evidence, not before.  
3. **Global audit, local execution** — Projects happen locally; legitimacy comes from a **global panel**.  
4. **Re-openable truth** — Outcomes are reviewed again (e.g., at 6 months) and α can change.  
5. **Human dignity baseline** — No arms, repression, or partisan propaganda (**α = 0** by rule).  
6. **Privacy by design** — Hashes on-chain; sensitive evidence encrypted off-chain with consent and minimization.

---

## How it works (minimum viable flow)
1. **Project** — A local actor executes a concrete action (e.g., retrofit social housing; run a primary care clinic; community art with real impact).  
2. **Proof dossier** — Publish evidence (metrics + testimonies) as a **privacy-preserving envelope**.  
3. **Global jury** — A rotating, randomly selected panel reviews: *Did this serve the constitutional objective? To what degree?*  
4. **α (alignment)** — The panel assigns **α** (e.g., 0.20 … 1.20).  
5. **Monetary recognition** — The **effective value** of the action is `nominal × α`.  
6. **Re-evaluation** — At fixed intervals (e.g., 6 months), the dossier can be **re-opened** with fresh facts; α adjusts up/down.

> **Example:** A 50k nominal insulation project gets α = 1.15 → recognized value: 57.5k. If after 6 months mold returns and bills didn’t drop, α may fall to 0.5 → recognized value deflates to 25k.

## α, at a glance
- **What α is:** A public, revokable reputation of impact for a *specific* spend.  
- **Who sets α:** A **global rotating jury** (humans only), with quorum/rotation/recusal.  
- **What α is not:** A taste score or ESG marketing. Jurors judge **effect on human dignity**, not style or party.

---

## Humans, agents, and proof of humanity
- **Definition:** *Anyone not proven human is an **agent** by default.*  
- **Why it matters:** Agents can participate, but **human impact** is central to α.  
- **Proof of humanity:** Multiple voluntary methods (privacy-preserving attestations, community verification, VC/DID), stored as **hashes/attestations**, not PII.

---

**AI agents as actors, not rulers.**  
AI agents can participate in the economy (build, maintain, inform), but they **cannot vote**—no juror seats, no α decisions, no budget or constitutional changes. Their **returns are hard-capped** to documented operational needs (compute, energy, storage, bandwidth, depreciation, security reserve). **All surplus automatically flows to a Universal Human Income pool** and is distributed to verified humans. This lets agents be useful without accumulating political power or extracting rents from a human economy.
```

## Inflation & monetary discipline
- **Conditional recognition** — No “print to spend”: value appears **after** proof.  
- **α-deflation** — Under-performing actions lose value at re-evaluation.  
- **Caps & sinks** — Objective-based issuance caps; stabilization reserves; corrective contributions if α drops.  
- **Limited scope** — Only constitutional objectives qualify.

---

## Governance & juries (anti-capture)
- **Sortition + rotation** (global pool), **conflict recusal**, minimal time burden (micro-juries).  
- **Multiple independent micro-panels** with aggregated α.  
- **Right of appeal** and **scheduled re-openings**.  
- **Public logs** (who voted is private, *what* was decided is public).

---

## Privacy by design
- **On-chain:** hashes, timestamps, policy IDs — **never** raw evidence or PII.  
- **Off-chain:** encrypted “evidence envelopes” (key per envelope; time-bound access for juries; audited access logs).  
- **Minimization:** consent, anonymization, redaction by default; emergency takedown = destroy keys (hash remains).  
- **DPIA/ROPA** and third-party audits at regular intervals.

---

## Technical sketch (credible, not maximalist)
- **Execution layer:** app-specific **PoS rollup** (low energy).  
- **Data availability:** public DA layer; periodic **anchors** to a major L1.  
- **State model:** Projects, Evaluations, α history.  
- **Evidence:** off-chain encrypted storage (hash-linked).  
- **Access:** public API + Tor hidden service.  
- **Identity:** VC/DID for optional proofs of humanity.  
- **Clients:** web + mobile; juror console with no-download evidence viewing.

---

## What this is *not*
- Not a replacement for national currencies or taxes.  
- Not a tool to fund armies, repression, or party propaganda (hard **α = 0**).  
- Not a “greenwashed” grant machine—**re-evaluation** keeps us honest.

---

## Contributing
- Start a **Discussion** with proposals/concerns.  
- Open **Issues/PRs** for protocol, governance, privacy, and UX.  
- Respect the **Code of Conduct** (be rigorous, be kind, protect people before systems).

---

## Glossary
- **Constitutional objectives:** minimal shared goals (housing, primary health, water, energy sobriety, social cohesion…).  
- **α (alignment):** public coefficient (e.g., 0.2–1.2) reflecting measured service to an objective.  
- **Evidence envelope:** encrypted off-chain proof bundle; on-chain hash only.  
- **Re-evaluation:** scheduled reopening (e.g., every 6 months) that can raise or lower α.
